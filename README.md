# CryptoClustering
In this module we are looking at the Crypto currencies and looking at the affects of the past 24 hours and 7 days for the data used. 
I used the standard scaler and scikit learn modules to normalize the data. 
Then I worked the data in jupyter notebook to find the best value for k using the scaled dataframe. 
After that i used the k-means model with the best value for k, and used that to create a clusters group and scatter plot.
Then I took the scaled DataFrame and reduced the data to a PCA using 3 principal components. 
I repeated the process used for the original data and then compared the 2 methods of viewing the clusters.
